This is where I document my journey as a backend software engineer—projects, failures, lessons learned. I'll explore new languages like Rust, Go, and Elixir, alongside deep dives into machine learning, vector databases, CLIP, agents, and recommendation systems.  

With over seven years of experience in application architecture and distributed systems, I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with cutting-edge technology. Whether it’s designing scalable infrastructure, building search systems, or leveraging ML frameworks like Hugging Face and TFX, I care about the code behind the product as much as the product itself.  

Expect a mix of hands-on experiments, deep technical dives, and thoughts on the evolving software landscape. Let’s build something great.
